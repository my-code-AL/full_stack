## How does AJAX help my web app

AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, greatly enhances web applications by enabling asynchronous communication with the server. This technology facilitates partial updates to web pages, allowing for smoother user interactions without requiring the entire page to reload. This results in a more responsive and dynamic user experience, as AJAX requests can be made in the background, reducing latency and enabling the simultaneous execution of other page functions. Moreover, AJAX contributes to improved robustness by isolating errors to specific components, ensuring that the failure of one request doesn't disrupt the entire application.

Additionally, AJAX significantly improves the efficiency of data transfer between the client and server. By fetching only the essential data, bandwidth usage is optimized, benefiting users with slower internet connections. The technology's ability to dynamically load content, submit forms without page refreshes, and provide real-time updates further enhances the overall speed and interactivity of web applications, contributing to a more seamless and engaging user experience.

## Environment

* Node.js v16.20.2
* macOS Ventura 13.0 Apple Silicon

Browsers:
* Firefox 106.0.1 (64-bit)
* Chrome 106.0.5249.119 (Official Build) (arm64)
* Safari Version 16.1 (18614.2.9.1.12)

I would test my code on the major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS) and the major browsers
(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera) to make sure the code works for the majority of the users.
