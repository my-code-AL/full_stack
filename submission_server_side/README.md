## How does REST help my web app

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a set of principles that describe how HTTP standards can be used to an interface in a client-server system.

The biggest benefit of REST is the simplicity and the reduction of overhead. Simple data formats like JSON are used, and they are easier to create and consume.

By using a stateless protocol (HTTP) and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Environment
